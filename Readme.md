# How to Localize the Reporting Controls in an Angular JavaScript Application

This example includes the server-side (backend) application that is an ASP.NET MVC application created from the DevExpress Visual Studio template as described in the [Report Designer's Server-Side Configuration (ASP.NET MVC)](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/118371) topic.

The client-side (front-end) application is created as described in the [Report Designer Integration in Angular](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/119431) document.

To run the example, perform the following steps:

1. Open the **CS** or **VB** solution in Visual Studio and rebuild to install the required NuGet packages.
2. Run the Visual Studio project.
2. Open the command prompt, navigate to the **JS\angular-report-designer** folder and run the commands:
    
```
npm install
ng serve
```

5. Open the URL **localhost:4200**  in your browser.
